Customer Segmentation Analysis
This project segments shopping mall customers based on demographics and behavior, aiming to identify actionable groups for targeted marketing and business insights. The analysis uses Python's robust data handling, visualization, and machine learning libraries.

Business Problems Addressed
Customer Identification: How can we identify distinct customer groups based on their age, income, and spending patterns?

Hidden Opportunities: Are there high-spending customer groups hidden within the business, or certain demographic segments prone to higher or lower spending?

Marketing Optimization: How can we better target marketing campaigns and improve retention based on true customer profiles rather than simple guesswork?

Tech Stack and Tools Used
Python: End-to-end programming for data manipulation, exploration, and modeling

Pandas: Data cleaning, inspection, grouping, and pivot analysis

NumPy: Numerical operations and feature engineering

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualizations including distributions, heatmaps, and scatterplots

scikit-learn: Feature scaling and K-Means clustering

Project Workflow
1. Data Import & Cleaning
Inspected for missing values and duplicates

Ensured each customer had a unique ID

2. Feature Engineering & Grouping
Grouped customers by age and income brackets

Prepared features for grouped analysis and clustering

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized distributions of age, income, and spending scores

Correlation checks to understand feature relationships

Statistical tests for normality (Shapiro-Wilk)

4. Key Business Insights
Identified top 10 customers by spending and income

Compared spending patterns across age/income groups

Summarized key differences in shopping behavior by gender

5. Customer Segmentation (K-Means)
Used standardized age, income, and spending features

Found optimal number of customer segments using the elbow method

Interpreted clusters as meaningful business personas

6. Reporting & Business Utility
Output labeled customer data ready for targeted marketing

Calculated the percentage of high and low spenders in each group

Saved segment results for integration into future business intelligence or CRM systems

Project Impact & Results
Four Major Clusters: Revealed four customer clusters, each with distinctive demographic and spending characteristics

Business Opportunities: Younger customers were more likely to be high spenders, but high income didn't guarantee high spending

Strategic Insights: Delivered insights for more precise, data-driven marketing and customer retention strategies

Business-Ready Output: Prepared all analytical steps and visualizations in a business-ready, reusable code format
